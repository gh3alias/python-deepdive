    "When we were looking at decorators we wrote a timing decorator. It could even take a number of repititions as a parameter. This can be handy to time functions directly in your code without affecting the result of the function. But it wrote the results out to the console, and sometimes we just want to access the timing data right inside our Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `timeit` module in Python is an alternative that works well for some things. It is a little more complicated to use because it runs 'outside' of our local namespace, and you have to pass just small snippets of code to it (well you pass multi-line chunks of code, but it gets tedious), and you also have to make it aware of you global or local scope if that's needed by the code you want to time. One thing it does that we did not do was *temporarily disable* the garbage collector. Still, there are a lot of pitfalls to benchmarking, and this approach like ours, is good enough for most cases. YMMV.\n",
